    <h1 id="VISIT">Ciliwung River</h1>
    <P id="ABOUT"> Ci Liwung (often written as Ciliwung; also as Tjiliwoeng in Dutch) is a 119 km long river in the northwestern region of Java where it flows through two provinces, West Java and the special region of Jakarta. 
        The natural estuary of the Ciliwung river, known as the Kali Besar ("Big River"), was an important strategic point for trade in the precolonial and colonial periods and was instrumental in the founding of the 
        port city of Jakarta, but has been lost from reorganization of the watercourse of the rivers around the area into canals. It is known as one of the dirtiest river here in Indonesia. </P>

    
    <h1>Why is it so dirty?</h1>
    <p>The people who live near the river has polluted the river for many years. We discovered that they lacked water resource, 
        therefore they use water from the river to do their daily activities. such as:

    <p>Here are some pictures of the Ciliwung River that we took. As we can see, the water is 
        dirty and there are litter everywhere. Not just in the water, but also on the sides of the river.
        Previously, there were no fish inside since there were too many trash in the water. But these days, they are
        starting to come back.

    <h1 id="INTERVIEW">Meet Bapak Royani!</h1>
    <p>We interviewed Bapak Royani, head of the 'Peduli Ciliwung' community. His community tries to make the Ciliwung River cleaner
        and better everyday. He gave us many useful information on how us, non Ciliwung residence, can still help. He mentioned that 
        trying to change the residence mindset is not an easy task. Rather than educating the people of Ciliwung, it's best for us to educate
        the people who's able to make a change. Such as people who are willing to donate, willing to make a change in their life that can help not justt
        themselves, but also the people surrounding them. We, as the young generation, can help by socializing this problem through social media so that 
        more people can know and help. He mentioned that even small changes are still changes. Therefore, our help big or small, will still give a great impact.

    <h1>What we did</h1>
    <p> After discussing with Bapak Royani, we planted a tree near the Ciliwung River. In the previous interview, Bapak Royani 
    said that planting a tree and planting fish seeds is an effective way to help Ciliwung River gain its healthy ecosystem back.
